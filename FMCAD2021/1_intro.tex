solve string constraint is hard

strategy: do unsat and sat separately

strategy: using different procedure to (dis)prove validaity

for disprove validatity, there are two approches, first is bound string length

cannot handle $x.y \neq z  \wedge |x| > 2000$

more recent approach is flattening

it is known that word equaltion + flat regular constraints + len constraints
is decidable

it was unknown that whether word equations + flat regular constraints + len constraints + parseInt is decidable
